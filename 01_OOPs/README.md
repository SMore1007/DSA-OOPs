# OOPs Interview Questions

    1. What is OOP?

        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code using objects, 
        which bundle data and behavior together.

    2. What are the four pillars of OOP?

        Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

    3. What is Encapsulation?

        Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods inside a class, 
        restricting direct access to some components.

    4. What is Abstraction?

        Abstraction hides implementation details and only exposes essential features to the user.

    5. What is Inheritance?

        Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, 
        promoting code reusability.

    6. What is Polymorphism?

        Polymorphism allows the same function or operator to behave differently 
        based on the object it is acting upon.

    7. What is the difference between compile-time and run-time polymorphism?

        Compile-time polymorphism (function overloading, operator overloading) is resolved at compile-time, while run-time polymorphism (virtual functions) is resolved at runtime.

    8. What is a virtual function?

        A virtual function in C++ allows method overriding in derived classes and supports
        runtime polymorphism.

    9. What is a pure virtual function?

        A pure virtual function is declared in a base class with = 0, making it mandatory 
        for derived classes to implement it.

    10. What is an abstract class?

        A class with at least one pure virtual function is called an abstract class and 
        cannot be instantiated.

    11. What is a constructor?

        A constructor is a special function that initializes an object when it is created.

    12. What is a destructor?

        A destructor is a special function that is automatically called when an object goes out of
        scope to release resources.

    13. What is operator overloading?

        Operator overloading allows redefining the behavior of operators for user-defined types.

    14. What is function overloading?

        Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter
        lists.

    15. What is function overriding?

        Function overriding allows a derived class to provide a new implementation for a base
        class method.

    16. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?

        A shallow copy copies only the pointer to dynamically allocated memory, 
        whereas a deep copy creates a new copy of the memory.

    17. What is the use of this pointer?

        The this pointer refers to the current instance of the class inside a member function.

    18. What is a friend function?

        A friend function can access private and protected members of a class without being a member of the class.

    19. What is multiple inheritance?

        Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class.

    20. What is a virtual base class?

        A virtual base class prevents multiple copies of a base class when using multiple
        inheritance.
