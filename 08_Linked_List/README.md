# 🔗 Linked List in C

This repository contains a detailed implementation of **Linked Lists** in C programming language. It includes:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Basic Operations like insertion, deletion, search, traversal

## 📚 What is a Linked List?

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (called a **node**) contains:

- `data` – the value stored in the node
- `next` – a pointer to the next node in the list

## 🧠 Why Use Linked Lists?

- Dynamic memory allocation (no predefined size like arrays)
- Efficient insertions/deletions (especially in the middle of the list)
- Great for building stacks, queues, and graphs

## 🧰 Features & Operations

Each linked list type has basic operations:

### ✅ Singly Linked List

- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert at a given position
- Delete a node
- Search a node
- Display list

### ✅ Doubly Linked List

- Traverse forward and backward
- Insert and delete from both ends

### ✅ Circular Linked List

- Last node points to the head
- Good for round-robin scheduling
